                63 areas have been pre-identified using a prioritization
                modeling approach that meets multiple objectives of this
                planning process while minimizing overlap with current deepwater
                longline fishing grounds. Consider including these areas in
                order to achieve planning goals while minimizing cost to this
                fishery.

                This report summarizes the percentage of the 63 areas that

                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: A prioritization model was used to generate a
                  network of 63 potential protected areas. The model was
                  designed to optimize for restoring fish stocks of deep-sea
                  species while protecting natural diversity, ecosystem
                  structure, function, connectivity and resilience of deep-sea
                  communities in the Azores. It also used a{" "}
                  <i>varying fisheries-based cost model</i> in order avoid areas
                  with higher fishing effort and thus reduce the impact to this
                  fishery.

                  üéØ Planning Objective: there is no specific objective for
                  including these priority areas in your plan, but they can be
                  used to guide discussion.
                </p>
                üìà Report: Percentages are calculated by summing the portion of
                priority areas found within the plans MPAs, and dividing it by
                the sum of all priority areas. If the plan includes multiple
                MPAs that overlap, the overlap is only counted once.
