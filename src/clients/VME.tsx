                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: Known VMEs are defined as areas that have been
                  scientifically explored, described, and that meet the FAO
                  criteria (FAO, 2009) for defining Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems
                  (Section 5.1.5).
                </p>
                <p>
                  12 large areas where identified that fit the FAO criteria
                  defining what constitutes a Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem (FAO,
                  2009). These areas consist of 3 portions of the MAR (Western
                  ridge, Ridge east of Gigante, Cavalo), eight seamounts (Oscar,
                  Gigante, Cavala, Beta, Voador, Condor, Don Jo√£o de Castro, and
                  Formigas), and an area with several small mounds south-east of
                  Pico island. The seafloor west of Capelinhos volcano, in Faial
                  island, also fitted the FAO criteria and considered a VME but
                  is outside the spatial planning area (i.e. within 6nm from
                  shore).

                <p>
                  üó∫Ô∏è Source Data: Unequivocal VMEs were identified based on
                  these criteria through analysis of video transects recorded
                  during exploration cruises. They consisted of known
                  hydrothermal vents and, particularly, vulnerable benthic
                  communities, which is mostly consisted of cold-water corals
                  and sponge aggregations.

                <p>
                  A contour of the 12 areas was computed using the best
                  available bathymetry data. The PUs covered by more than 5% by
                  these VME polygons were kept as important areas.
